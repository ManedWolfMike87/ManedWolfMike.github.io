The sentence here that has strong applied to it might show up in a browser, but it's only because modern browsers are very forgiving of html errors.-->

I would suggest you don't put in a tbody unless you also have a thead, but, in this case, the contents of the first row is actually appropriate for the header section of the table, so I'd put the first row in a thead and the other row in a tbody.-->

This single th tag means that this table is only one column wide, but in the next row down, you specify 4 td tags, which is confusing. If you want this single th tag to span across 4 columns, you should put the attribute colspan="4" within the th element.-->
