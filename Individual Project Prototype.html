                The story of the development of my system the Saturn started back in as early as 2016, when
                I became instead inspired in the middle of my art class to pursue my senior project.
                I began to ponder what it would be like to build a server computer to replace the older unit that 
                ran my school's primary server banks. So a plan began to form inside my head,
                and finally, I made a decision. To achieve the goal of building a system capable of handling such a task, 
                I would need to experiment and get my hands a bit dirty to understand how to build a computer properly. 
                So over a couple months, I created Four prototypes would test my skills in computer building, and two of the four were successful.

            These prototypes were my first attempts in dabbling in computer building,
            and in addition, this also began to build my passion for computers as a whole.
            this was only the start of my journey, however, as I still had much planning
            and building to do before I would indeed become worthy of constructing my own
            computer system.
            Also, while I do not have much footage of my prototypes, I did take the time to 
            make a dedicated video for the HECKLER T, and here is the video I uploaded.

            About two years into my work, I began to build more powerful prototypes that would prove very successful 
            in the long run. They helped open the floodgates for my skills to strive towards building machines out of 
            more modern and complex parts. The first system to become my primary computer was the HECKLER Sentinel mk.1, 
            a small half-height tower system that I modified to run as fast as possible. It lasted me a few months before 
            I strived towards a more traditional tower design. This resulted in an experimental model called the HECKLER
             Sentinel mk.2 being built, which lasted only a few weeks before moving onto two new models. The HECKLER Classic, 
             which was a modern PC crammed into an old 2004 HP Pavillion case And the HECKLER Sentinel mk.2.5, which was a much 
             taller tower system. The last version of the Sentinel series was a modified version of the 2.5, which I named the 
             HECKLER Sentinel mk.3. The mk.3 was the very first of my prototypes to feature a quad-core CPU, and would be the final 
             prototype I would build.
