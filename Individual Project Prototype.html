            <!--Mark Comment 5/16: specializes-->
            Intel is a company that specilizes in the creation of computer processors and are one of the pioneers
            of modern computers.

            I rather like intel, as I have been a user of their products and many machines that utilize
            thier products over many years. However, while at one point they were very good at being an
            amazing manufacturer, their golden years are certainly behind them. They have made a multitude
            of poor choices in the past few years that has made their modern processors a bit of a joke
            compared to newer chips on the market. A good example is the Apple M1 all-in-one microprocessor,
            which has become Apples new uniqe chip. Something that Apple has not had for many many years.
            This new chip has replaced Intel in Apple's lineup of future systems, and needless to say
            intel was not happy about being both given the boot and being outclassed by a superior chip.
            Hopefully Intel may work out their kinks and become a good company again, but time will tell.
