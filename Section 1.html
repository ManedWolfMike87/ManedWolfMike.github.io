            The story of the development of my system the Saturn started back in as early as 2016, when
            I became instead inspired in the middle of my art class to pursue my senior project.
            I began to ponder what it would be like to build a server computer to replace the older unit that
            ran my school's primary server banks. So a plan began to form inside my head,
            and finally, I made a decision. To achieve the goal of building a system capable of handling such a task,
            I would need to experiment and get my hands a bit dirty to understand how to build a computer properly.
            So over a couple months, I created Four prototypes that would test my skills in computer building, and
            two of the four were successful.

                Prototype 1: "The HECKLER 404"

            These prototypes were my first attempts in dabbling in computer building,
            and in addition, this also began to build my passion for computers as a whole.
            this was only the start of my journey, however, as I still had much planning
            and building to do before I would indeed become worthy of constructing my own
            computer system.
            Also, while I do not have much footage of my prototypes, I did take the time to
            make a dedicated video for the HECKLER T, and here is the video I uploaded.
