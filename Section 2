            About two years into my work, I began to build more powerful prototypes that would prove very successful
            in the long run. They helped open the floodgates for my skills to strive towards building machines out of
            more modern and complex parts. The first system to become my primary computer was the HECKLER Sentinel mk.1,
            a small half-height tower system that I modified to run as fast as possible. It lasted me a few months
            before
            I strived towards a more traditional tower design. This resulted in an experimental model called the HECKLER
            Sentinel mk.2 being built, which lasted only a few weeks before moving onto two new models. The HECKLER
            Classic,
            which was a modern PC crammed into an old 2004 HP Pavillion case And the HECKLER Sentinel mk.2.5, which was
            a
            much
            taller tower system. The last version of the Sentinel series was a modified version of the 2.5, which I
            named
            the
            HECKLER Sentinel mk.3. The mk.3 was the very first of my prototypes to feature a quad-core CPU, and would be
            the
            final
            prototype I would build.

            The Sentinel mk.3 would mark the end of my prototype era and then pave the way
            for my future creation. This model utilized somewhat more modern parts than my
            previous models and would serve as the basis for my design moving forward.
            Having a powerful CPU, large stylish but modern case, multiple media components,
            a dedicated graphics card, and a large amount of RAM and storage.
