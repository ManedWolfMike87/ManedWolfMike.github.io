            In 2018 I began to formulate my master plan to build my supercomputer and use it as the basis
            for my senior project. My idea was to use my original concept of building a computer to replace my
            school's old server controller system with a more powerful and modern one. So I set out to get the
            money for the many parts I would need over nearly a solid year and a half of hard work. I did many
            odd jobs and eventually became employed at a McDonald's restaurant (which was not that great but
            a good learning experience). Finally, I was able to purchase the needed parts to build my creation,
            which I lovingly named "The HECKLER Saturn."

            it when I first bought it.

            The Saturn Proved to be a mighty and sound machine when I first created it.
            It has been one of my first significant accomplishments, and it would lead to even more accomplishments as
            well!
            Firstly, I would graduate High school despite not passing the final exam I needed to give. This
            is because
            there was a loophole found that stated if my SAT score was above a specific marker, it could count for
            my exam in its place.
            Not only was my SAT score good enough to get me out of High school, but it also was enough to get me
            accepted to
            in all honesty, the best University for me. UWB is a quiet and relaxing place for studying and working
            towards my dream
            of getting a major in Applied Computing, which also was kickstarted by both my love of computers and the
            completion of the
            Saturn. If I had not started on the path to building this incredible machine, I would not be where I am
            today.
